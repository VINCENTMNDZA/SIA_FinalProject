        <div class="x"><p> <a href= "https://www.pcgamer.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-is-now-available-on-steam-early-access/" class="l">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds </a> exploded into Early Access in March and quickly became the PC's most popular battle royale: roughly 100 players parachute from a plane onto a 18x18km island, search for weapons and gear, and fight to the death. All the while, a shrinking circle closes around the island, a blue energy field that damages the health of players caught in it. Players must travel, by foot or in vehicles, into the safe area, drawing closer and closer to the remaining players for a final showdown. The last one left alive wins.

            While Battlegrounds doesn't have the raw complexity of Arma, there are still a few things you need to know before your boots hit the ground (and you swap them for different boots). Here are our best tips on staying alive and winning in PUBG. </p>

        <p>It’s funny you bring up the airdrops. That plane comes back throughout the game and drops crates of high-end gear. The friends I play with tend to avoid them like the plague. We like to setup gunfights where we control our placement as much as possible until the endgame brawl, and the Hunger Games-style scramble that happens near airdrops is a good way to get killed by players with much greater mechanical skill.
            <br>
            PUBG excels at letting the players figure out how they want to play, and that initial jump from the plane is a big part of it. You have to decide if you want to jump near a lot of other players and duke it out early, or begin near the edge of the map and build up a good loadout before you move inward and encounter other players. The further out you get, however, the more you have to deal with that moving barrier. I’ve died plenty of these deaths: I looted a building, only to realize at the last moment that I didn’t have the time to run to the next area, and got wiped out by the barrier.</p>

                PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds popularly known as PUBG  has been emerged as the biggest game attracting a big audience  of gamers in 2017 and indeed gave a tough competition to some of the big competitive game titles including  League of Legends , Dota 2 , CounterStrike Global offensive.
                <br>
                You always feel like you’re making progress, and every instance of enemy contact is a very big deal. There is nothing that gets my heart racing more than hearing the flat crack of gunshots from the next town over.
