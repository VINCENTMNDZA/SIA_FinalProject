        <p>It’s funny you bring up the airdrops. That plane comes back throughout the game and drops crates of high-end gear. The friends I play with tend to avoid them like the plague. We like to setup gunfights where we control our placement as much as possible until the endgame brawl, and the Hunger Games-style scramble that happens near airdrops is a good way to get killed by players with much greater mechanical skill.
            <br>
            PUBG excels at letting the players figure out how they want to play, and that initial jump from the plane is a big part of it. You have to decide if you want to jump near a lot of other players and duke it out early, or begin near the edge of the map and build up a good loadout before you move inward and encounter other players. The further out you get, however, the more you have to deal with that moving barrier. I’ve died plenty of these deaths: I looted a building, only to realize at the last moment that I didn’t have the time to run to the next area, and got wiped out by the barrier.
